## üéØ LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Dashboard was working at baseline** - no fixes needed initially
2. **API endpoint changes broke functionality** - need careful testing
3. **Email system integration caused crashes** - needs isolation
4. **Multiple debugging attempts created more issues** - keep changes minimal
5. **Import/export mismatches cause build failures** - verify syntax

---

## üìã NEXT STEPS (When Ready to Try Again)

1. **Start from WORKING_DASHBOARD_STATE tag**
2. **Make ONE change at a time**
3. **Test thoroughly after each change**
4. **Keep changes minimal and isolated**
5. **Don't attempt multiple fixes simultaneously**

## üö® CRITICAL NOTES

- **Always test dashboard after each commit**
- **Don't mix email system changes with dashboard fixes**
- **Verify all imports/exports before committing**
- **Use proper TypeScript syntax**
- **Test build process before pushing**
