1.2. Account Types: The Service offers different account types, including but not limited to "Landlord," "Agent," and "Tenant." Your access to features will depend on your account type and subscription plan.

1.3. Account Security: You are responsible for safeguarding your account password and for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your account.

1.4. Super Admin and Moderators: We reserve the right to create and manage "Super Admin" and "Super Moderator" accounts with elevated privileges to administer the platform, manage user accounts, and ensure the security and integrity of the Service.

2. Subscriptions and Billing

2.1. Plans and Pricing: Our Service is offered under various subscription plans, including a "Free Trial," "Landlord Plan," and "Agent Plan." The features and pricing for each plan are detailed on our Pricing page. All fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise specified.

2.2. Billing: By selecting a paid plan, you agree to pay the applicable subscription fees. All payments will be processed by our third-party payment processor, 2Checkout. You agree to provide them with valid and updated payment information.

2.3. Manual Subscription Control: We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, for Super Admins or Moderators to manually activate, deactivate, or modify the duration of any subscription plan for any user account for administrative, support, or billing-related reasons.

2.4. Renewals & Cancellation: Paid subscriptions will automatically renew for the same subscription period unless you cancel your plan through your account's billing settings. You may cancel at any time, and your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle.

3. User Data & Content

3.1. Ownership: You retain all ownership rights to the data, information, and content you upload to the Service ("Your Content"). This includes property details, tenant information, and financial records.

3.2. License to Us: By using the Service, you grant us a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive license to host, copy, transmit, and display Your Content as necessary for us to provide the Service to you.

3.3. Acceptable Use: You agree not to upload or transmit any content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, abusive, fraudulent, or obscene, or that infringes on any third-party's intellectual property rights.

4. Data Portability & Account Deletion

4.1. Data Export: You may request an export of Your Content at any time through the "Settings" page in your dashboard. We will make a good faith effort to provide your data in a common electronic format (e.g., CSV).

4.2. Account Deletion: You may request the permanent deletion of your account and all associated data through your "Settings" page.
- Admin Control: We reserve the right for a Super Admin or Moderator to enable or disable the self-service account deletion feature for any organization.
- Process: Once a deletion request is confirmed, your account will be marked as "pending deletion" and will be permanently erased from our systems after a grace period (e.g., 14 days), during which you may be able to reverse the request by contacting support. This action is irreversible after the grace period.

5. Agent Data Syncing

The Service may provide features allowing a Super Admin or Moderator to sync or share specific data sets (e.g., property or tenant information) between different Agent accounts within the same or different organizations. This action will only be performed for administrative or support purposes and will be logged in the audit trail.

6. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, HNV shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service.

7. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will provide notice of any material changes by posting the new Terms on the Service or by sending you an email. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.
